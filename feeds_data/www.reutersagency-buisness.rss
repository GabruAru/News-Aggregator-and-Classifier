<p>Reuters <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/ecb-sounds-out-lenders-exposure-spanish-drugmaker-grifols-sources-2024-01-17/">exclusively reported</a></strong> that the European Central Bank was asking banks to detail their exposure to Spanish drugmaker Grifols and a network of companies linked to the founding family, days after the Barcelona-based business was accused of manipulating its financial accounts by a short-seller. The story also revealed how supervisors were concerned that the huge drop in Grifols’ share price could require family-connected companies which have borrowed using Grifols stock as collateral to post more margin. Grifols denies all the allegations made by Gotham City Research, the short-seller. The story was picked up by Bloomberg, Spain’s state-owned news agency, EFE, and made it into several newspapers including Expansion, El Mundo and the front page of business daily Cinco Dias. </p>
